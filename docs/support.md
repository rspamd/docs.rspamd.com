# Support Options

Rspamd is free and open source software. The developers are mostly volunteers who provide user support in their free time. Before asking for help, please check our [Documentation](/) first, especially the [Rspamd Quick Start](./tutorials/quickstart) and [Frequently Asked Questions](./faq).

## Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests

If you find a bug or would like to request a specific feature, please use our issue tracker hosted on GitHub. We also welcome pull requests for any part of the project: documentation, website, WebUI, or Rspamd itself.
