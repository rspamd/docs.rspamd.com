# Rspamd Packages

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>
    <img src="/img/docker.png" width="20" alt="Docker logo" /> Docker

An official docker image is available at [rspamd/rspamd on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rspamd/rspamd), with sources [on GitHub](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd-docker). This is a recommended way to run Rspamd.

In this build, upstream config files are installed in `/usr/share/rspamd/config`, allowing `/etc/rspamd` to contain only local configuration.

This build provides a [language identification model](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html) to enable language detection using `fasttext`, distributed under [version 3.0 of the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Volumes or bind mounts should be used for the `/var/lib/rspamd` directory and optionally for `/etc/rspamd`. If bind mounts are used, the `/var/lib/rspamd` directory should be writable by `11333:11333` on the host machine.

The root directory may be set read-only for added security at the cost of being less tactile for the administrator.

Basic usage:

```bash
docker run -v rspamd_dbdir:/var/lib/rspamd -v rspamd_confdir:/etc/rspamd -ti rspamd/rspamd
```

A [Docker compose example](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd-docker/tree/main/examples/compose) is available in the source repo.

  <TabItem value="rhel" label="RHEL">
    <img src="/img/redhat.png" width="20" alt="Red Hat logo" /> RHEL-alike distributions

Packages are available for RHEL-compatible distributions such as Oracle Linux, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, and CentOS. Currently, versions 8 through 10 are supported.

Please note that these packages **require** [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) to be installed on your system as many dependencies are missing from the base repositories.

Please bear in mind that you might also need the debug symbols package for Rspamd to be able to file bug reports about possible crashes. Debug symbols are placed in the `rspamd-debug` package and can be safely installed even in a production environment.

To install the rspamd repo, please download the corresponding repository file and the signing key (both repo and all packages are signed with my GPG key). You can use the following commands to install the rspamd stable<sup>1</sup> RPM repository:

```bash
source /etc/os-release
export EL_VERSION=`echo -n $PLATFORM_ID | sed "s/.*el//"`
curl https://rspamd.com/rpm-stable/centos-${EL_VERSION}/rspamd.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo
dnf install rspamd
```

For experimental<sup>2</sup> branch packages, download the `rpm-experimental` repofile as follows:

```bash
source /etc/os-release
export EL_VERSION=`echo -n $PLATFORM_ID | sed "s/.*el//"`
curl https://rspamd.com/rpm/centos-${EL_VERSION}/rspamd-experimental.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/rspamd.repo
dnf install rspamd
```

For asan<sup>3</sup> packages, install `rspamd-asan`.

---

<sup>1</sup> Use STABLE branch of packages: these packages are the official rspamd releases which are recommended for production usage.

<sup>2</sup> Use EXPERIMENTAL branch of packages: these packages are less stable and they are generated frequently from the current development branch. Experimental packages usually have more features but might be SOMETIMES broken in some points (nevertheless, bugs are usually quickly fixed after detection).

<sup>3</sup> Use ASAN branch of packages: these are packages (both stable and experimental) designed to debug Rspamd issues, especially core files, using advanced debugging tools. Use these packages if you encounter an issue in Rspamd and you want it to be fixed.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="debian" label="Debian/Ubuntu">
    <img src="/img/Ubuntu.png" width="20" alt="Ubuntu logo" /> Debian and Ubuntu Linux

Rspamd supports the following .deb based distributions:

- **Debian trixie** (since 3.13)
- **Debian bookworm** (since 3.5)
- **Debian bullseye**
- **Ubuntu focal** (since 2.5)
- **Ubuntu jammy** (since 3.3)
- **Ubuntu noble** (since 3.9)

To install the rspamd stable<sup>1</sup> apt repository, please use the following commands:

```bash
#apt update # if running a minimal system
#apt-get install sudo # if running a minimal system
sudo apt-get install -y lsb-release wget gpg  # for install
CODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -O- https://rspamd.com/apt-stable/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt-stable/ $CODENAME main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
echo "deb-src [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt-stable/ $CODENAME main"  | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install rspamd
```

For [Hyperscan](https://www.hyperscan.io/) and [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org) information see the [FAQ](./faq).

For experimental<sup>2</sup> branch replace `apt-stable` with just `apt`:

```bash
#apt update # if running a minimal system
#apt-get install sudo # if running a minimal system
sudo apt-get install -y lsb-release wget gpg  # for install
CODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -O- https://rspamd.com/apt-stable/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt/ $CODENAME main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
echo "deb-src [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt/ $CODENAME main"  | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install rspamd
```

For ASAN<sup>3</sup> branch install the `rspamd-asan` package instead of `rspamd` (since 3.5).

Please bear in mind that you might also need the debug symbols package for Rspamd to be able to file bug reports about possible crashes. Debug symbols are placed in the `rspamd-dbg` (or `rspamd-asan-dbg`) package and can be safely installed even in a production environment.
Check [the quick start document](./tutorials/quickstart#rspamd-installation) for further steps.

### Packages support policy

Check [the support policy document](#packages-support-policy) to clarify what OS versions are supported by Rspamd packages.

### Debian `standard` repos notes

Please **DO NOT** use those packages, as they are likely outdated and are not supported by the Rspamd project in any way (so any associated issue will likely be closed automatically). If you decide to use those packages then please address any issues to the Debian package maintainers.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bsd" label="BSD">
    <img src="/img/freebsd.png" width="20" alt="FreeBSD logo" /> BSD systems

Rspamd has been ported to the following BSD-like operating systems:

- **FreeBSD**
- **NetBSD**
- **OpenBSD**
- **macOS** (using MacPorts)

FreeBSD users can install Rspamd from [ports](https://www.freshports.org/mail/rspamd/) or use the experimental line of packages by [rspamd-devel](https://www.freshports.org/mail/rspamd-devel/) port.

Users of NetBSD (and other systems with pkgsrc) can use [pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.se/mail/rspamd).

OpenBSD users can use [ports](https://openports.pl/path/mail/rspamd).

macOS users can install from [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/rspamd):
```bash
sudo port install rspamd
sudo port load rspamd
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="source" label="Build from Source">
    <img src="/img/octocat.png" width="20" alt="GitHub logo" /> Build rspamd from the sources

If there are no packages for your system or you want custom build options, you can also build rspamd from the source code. To do that, grab the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd) using `git`:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd.git
```

### Build requirements

Rspamd requires several 3rd-party software packages to build and run:

* [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) - cryptography and SSL/TLS Toolkit
* [glib2](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) - common purposes library
* [ragel](https://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/) - state machine compiler
* [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/) - JIT compiler for [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) programming language. Plain Lua should work as well.
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) - build system used to configure rspamd
* [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/) - embedded database used to store some data by rspamd
* [libmagic](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) - common library for detecting file types
* [libicu](https://icu.unicode.org/) - unicode library
* [PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/) - regular expressions library
* [Hyperscan](https://www.hyperscan.io)/[Vectorscan](https://github.com/VectorCamp/vectorscan) - optional regexp performance boost library
* [zlib](https://zlib.net/) - compression library

You can either install them from sources or (recommended) install using the package manager of your system.

It is also highly recommended to use [Redis](https://redis.io) as it can be used by many Rspamd modules to improve their filtering quality (some modules will be turned off completely without Redis).

It is also recommended to build Rspamd with Hyperscan (x86_64 only) or Vectorscan (aarch64/ppc64le) and Jemalloc to improve performance.

### Build process

To build rspamd we recommend creating a separate build directory:

```bash
mkdir rspamd.build
cd rspamd.build
cmake ../rspamd -DENABLE_HYPERSCAN=ON -DENABLE_LUAJIT=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebuginfo
make
sudo make install
```

On unsupported Debian-alike or RPM-based systems, you might use in-repo fixtures to build a package.

An example for [Debian](https://debian.org/)-like systems:

```bash
export RSPAMD_VERSION=3.7.3 # set this to desired Rspamd version
git clone -b ${RSPAMD_VERSION} https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd.git
cd rspamd
sed -i s/\(.*\)/\(${RSPAMD_VERSION}\)/ debian/changelog
sed -i s/quilt/native/ debian/source/format
sudo apt install devscripts
mk-build-deps
sudo bash -c "dpkg -i rspamd-build-deps_${RSPAMD_VERSION}_*.deb && apt install -f -y"
debuild -us -uc
sudo "dpkg -i ../rspamd_${RSPAMD_VERSION}_*.deb"
```
