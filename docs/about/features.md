# Rspamd Features

Rspamd is a high-performance spam filtering system that combines traditional spam detection techniques with modern machine learning approaches. Each message is analyzed by multiple independent checks (called symbols) that contribute to a cumulative spam score. Based on this score and configurable thresholds, Rspamd recommends an action (reject, greylist, add header, or accept) to your mail server.

## Core Architecture Features

### Event-Driven Non-Blocking Architecture

Rspamd uses [libevent](https://libevent.org/) for asynchronous I/O operations, allowing a single worker process to handle thousands of concurrent connections without blocking.

**Technical details:**
- Non-blocking DNS lookups (hundreds of RBL/DKIM/SPF queries per message)
- Asynchronous Redis operations for statistics and learning
- Parallel HTTP requests to external services (antivirus, URL checkers)
- Async session tracking ensures no message is finalized until all checks complete

**Performance impact:**
- Single worker can process 100+ messages simultaneously
- Typical message scanning: 50-200ms (including all network operations)
- Memory footprint: ~50-100MB per worker process

See [Architecture documentation](/developers/architecture#event-driven-model) for internal details.

### Multi-Worker Process Model

Rspamd uses a master-worker architecture inspired by nginx:
- **Main process**: Configuration management, worker lifecycle, no message processing
- **Normal workers**: Message analysis and scoring
- **Proxy workers**: Protocol translation (milter, HTTP) and load balancing
- **Controller worker**: Web UI and management API
- **Fuzzy storage worker**: Distributed fuzzy hash storage

**Benefits:**
- Isolated processes improve stability (one worker crash doesn't affect others)
- Easy horizontal scaling (add more workers or servers)
- Zero-downtime configuration reloads (graceful worker restart)
- Per-worker resource limits prevent runaway processes

### Modular Plugin System

Over 60 built-in modules can be enabled/disabled/configured independently:

```hcl
# Example: Enable and configure SPF module
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/spf.conf
spf {
  external_relay = ["192.168.1.0/24"];  # Skip SPF for internal relays
  whitelist = ["example.com"];          # Whitelist trusted domains
}
```

**Module categories:**
- **Authentication**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC, ARC
- **Content analysis**: Regex rules, MIME checks, language detection
- **External services**: Antivirus, URL redirector, GPT integration
- **Statistics**: Bayes classifier, neural networks, fuzzy hashing
- **Policies**: Rate limiting, greylisting, whitelisting, force actions
- **Exporting**: ClickHouse, Elastic, metadata exporter

See [Modules documentation](/modules/) for complete list.

### Flexible Configuration System

Rspamd uses [UCL (Universal Configuration Language)](/configuration/ucl) - a JSON-compatible format with includes, macros, and inheritance:

```hcl
# Base configuration
reject = 15;

# Include external file
.include(try=true) "/etc/rspamd/custom-thresholds.conf"

# Conditional configuration
.if env.hostname =~ "mx[0-9]+" {
  workers = 8;  # More workers on MX servers
}

# Macros
.define MY_NETWORK "192.168.1.0/24"
whitelist_ip = "$MY_NETWORK";
```

**Configuration layers:**
1. Default config: `/etc/rspamd/rspamd.conf`
2. Module defaults: `/etc/rspamd/modules.d/*.conf`
3. Local overrides: `/etc/rspamd/local.d/*.conf` (recommended)
4. Force overrides: `/etc/rspamd/override.d/*.conf` (complete replacement)

See [Configuration fundamentals](/guides/configuration/fundamentals) for best practices.

## Advanced Analysis Features

**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):**
- Verifies cryptographic signatures in email headers
- Supports multiple signatures per message
- Caches public keys in Redis for performance
- Symbols: `R_DKIM_ALLOW`, `R_DKIM_REJECT`, `R_DKIM_TEMPFAIL`, `R_DKIM_PERMFAIL`

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication):**
- Combines SPF and DKIM results with domain policy
- Supports aggregate and forensic reporting
- Policy enforcement: none, quarantine, reject
- Symbols: `DMARC_POLICY_ALLOW`, `DMARC_POLICY_REJECT`, `DMARC_POLICY_QUARANTINE`, `DMARC_POLICY_SOFTFAIL`

See [SPF module](/modules/spf), [DKIM module](/modules/dkim), [DMARC module](/modules/dmarc), [ARC module](/modules/arc).

### Statistical Learning

**Bayesian Classification:**
- Token-based statistical analysis (words, patterns, metadata)
- Redis backend with automatic token expiration
- Per-user and per-language training support
- Autolearn mode: automatically train on high-confidence spam/ham

```hcl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/classifier-bayes.conf
backend = "redis";
new_schema = true;
expire = 8640000;  # 100 days

autolearn {
  spam_threshold = 12.0;
  ham_threshold = -2.0;
  check_balance = true;
}
```

**Neural Networks:**
- Multi-layer perceptron with rule outputs as inputs
- Automatically learns optimal symbol weight combinations
- Separate networks for short/medium/long messages
- Requires Redis for weight storage

```hcl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/neural.conf
rules {
  "NEURAL_SPAM" {
    train {
      max_trains = 10000;  # Training cycles
      max_usages = 100;    # Retrains after this many classifications
      spam_score = 8.0;    # Learn as spam if score >= 8
      ham_score = -2.0;    # Learn as ham if score <= -2
    }
  }
}
```

**Fuzzy Hashing:**
- Perceptual hashing identifies similar messages
- Resistant to minor content modifications
- Distributed storage with replication
- Encrypted communication between nodes

Use cases:
- Newsletter detection (shared fuzzy hash across servers)
- Spam campaign identification (similar messages)
- Hash sharing with trusted partners

See [Statistic configuration](/configuration/statistic), [Neural module](/modules/neural), [Fuzzy check module](/modules/fuzzy_check).

### Content Analysis

**Regular Expression Rules:**
- LuaJIT-optimized regex engine (Hyperscan on x86_64)
- Multi-expression matching in single pass
- Header, body, URL, and raw content matching

Example custom rule:
```lua
-- /etc/rspamd/local.d/custom_rules.lua
rspamd_config.SUSPICIOUS_ATTACHMENT = {
  callback = function(task)
    local parts = task:get_parts()
    for _, part in ipairs(parts) do
      local ext = part:get_extension()
      if ext and (ext == "exe" or ext == "scr" or ext == "bat") then
        return true, 1.0, ext  -- Return true, weight 1.0, attachment extension
      end
    end
    return false
  end,
  score = 5.0,
  group = "malware",
  description = "Suspicious executable attachment"
}
```

**MIME Structure Analysis:**
- Malformed MIME detection
- Charset validation and conversion
- Attachment type checking
- HTML/text ratio analysis
- Embedded image analysis

**Language and Charset Detection:**
- Automatic language identification (60+ languages)
- Mixed charset detection (common in spam)
- UTF-8 validation
- CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) support

**URL Processing:**
- Extracts URLs from HTML, text, and headers
- SURBL/URIBL lookups (real-time URL blacklists)
- URL redirector resolution (follows shortened URLs)
- Phishing detection (lookalike domains)
- TLD validation

See [Regexp module](/modules/regexp), [SURBL module](/modules/surbl), [Phishing module](/modules/phishing).

### Reputation and Blacklists

**RBL (Real-time Blackhole Lists):**
- Parallel DNS queries to multiple RBLs (50+ preconfigured)
- IP reputation: sender IP, email server IPs from headers
- Automatic retry logic and caching
- Configurable weights per RBL

Commonly used RBLs:
- Spamhaus (ZEN, DBL, PBL)
- SORBS
- SpamCop
- Barracuda
- URIBL (URL-based)

**ASN and Country Detection:**
- GeoIP2/MaxMind database integration
- ASN-based reputation scoring
- Country-specific rules

**IP Score Module:**
- Tracks IP reputation based on historical behavior
- Learns from user actions (spam/ham classification)
- Exponential decay for old data
- Whitelist trusted IPs automatically

See [RBL module](/modules/rbl), [ASN module](/modules/asn), [IP Score module](/modules/ip_score).

### Anti-Abuse Mechanisms

**Greylisting:**
- Temporary rejection of unknown sender/recipient pairs
- Legitimate MTAs retry within minutes; spambots don't
- Redis-backed triplet storage (IP, sender, recipient)
- Configurable delay and expiration

```hcl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/greylist.conf
greylist {
  expire = 86400;      # 24 hours
  timeout = 300;       # 5 minutes delay
  whitelist_ip = [];   # IPs to skip greylisting
  whitelist_rcpt = []; # Recipients to skip greylisting
}
```

**Rate Limiting:**
- Limits messages per time period by IP, sender, recipient, or custom selector
- Bucket-based rate limiting (token bucket algorithm)
- Multiple limit tiers (soft limits, hard limits)
- Redis-backed counters

```hcl
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/ratelimit.conf
rates {
  # Limit to 100 messages per hour per sender IP
  to = {
    bucket = {
      burst = 120;
      rate = "100 / 1h";
    }
  }

  # Limit to 1000 recipients per hour per authenticated user
  to_ip_from = {
    bucket = {
      burst = 1100;
      rate = "1000 / 1h";
    }
  }
}
```

**Spamtrap Detection:**
- Mark certain addresses as spamtraps
- Auto-learn as spam any message to spamtraps
- Feed spamtraps to Bayesian classifier
- Block sender IPs sending to spamtraps

See [Greylisting module](/modules/greylisting), [Ratelimit module](/modules/ratelimit), [Spamtrap module](/modules/spamtrap).

# Spam detection rate
rate(rspamd_spam_total[5m]) / rate(rspamd_scanned_total[5m])
```

See [Metric exporter module](/modules/metric_exporter).

## Deployment and Scalability

### High Availability

**Load Balancing:**
- Proxy worker can forward to multiple Normal workers
- Round-robin, hash-based, or least-connection algorithms
- Automatic failover on worker failure
- Health checks for backend workers

**Redis High Availability:**
- Redis Sentinel support for automatic failover
- Redis Cluster support for sharding
- Consistent hashing for multi-Redis setups
- Connection pooling and retry logic

**Fuzzy Storage Replication:**
- Master-slave replication for fuzzy hashes
- Mirroring mode: write to multiple storage nodes
- Encrypted replication channels

**Configuration Synchronization:**
- Centralized configuration management (version control)
- Configuration templating (Ansible, Puppet, Chef)
- Dynamic configuration updates via controller API

### Horizontal Scaling

**Typical deployment patterns:**

1. **Single server** (< 100K messages/day):
   ```
   MTA → Rspamd (proxy + normal + controller) → Redis
   ```

2. **Load-balanced** (100K - 1M messages/day):
   ```
                 ┌→ Rspamd Worker 1 ┐
   MTA → Rspamd Proxy →→ Rspamd Worker 2 → Redis
                 └→ Rspamd Worker 3 ┘
   ```

3. **Distributed** (> 1M messages/day):
   ```
   MTA Cluster → Hardware LB → Rspamd Proxy Cluster → Rspamd Worker Cluster → Redis Cluster
   ```

**Performance expectations:**
- Single worker: 5-10 messages/sec (500K-1M messages/day)
- 4-worker server: 20-40 messages/sec (2-3M messages/day)
- DNS resolver speed is often the bottleneck (use local recursive resolver)

See [Architecture deployment patterns](/developers/architecture#deployment-patterns).

### Security

**HTTPCrypt Protocol:**
- Lightweight encryption for inter-server communication
- X25519 key exchange + XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption
- Forward secrecy with ephemeral keys
- No certificate management (public key cryptography)

```hcl
# Enable encryption between proxy and workers
# /etc/rspamd/local.d/worker-proxy.inc
upstream "backend" {
  hosts = "backend1.example.com:11333";
  encryption = {
    type = "httpcrypt";
    pubkey = "your-public-key-here";
  };
}
```

**Secure Defaults:**
- Web interface bound to localhost by default
- No open ports on public interfaces
- Minimal attack surface (no direct MTA protocol handling)
- Regular security updates

See [Encryption documentation](/developers/encryption) for cryptographic details.

### Resource Efficiency

**Memory Management:**
- Custom memory pools for per-message allocations
- Bulk deallocation when message processing completes
- Typical memory usage: 50-100MB per worker
- No memory leaks in core (valgrind-tested)

**CPU Optimization:**
- Zero-copy message handling where possible
- Regex engine optimization (Hyperscan on x86_64)
- LuaJIT for fast rule execution
- SIMD operations for fuzzy hashing

**Disk I/O:**
- Minimal disk writes (only logs)
- All working data in Redis (in-memory)
- Optional persistent history (SQLite or ClickHouse)

**Network Optimization:**
- Connection pooling for Redis, HTTP, and DNS
- Parallel DNS queries (configurable socket count)
- Keep-alive connections where supported
- Request pipelining for batch operations

## Extending Rspamd

### Lua Plugin Development

Write custom plugins in Lua with full access to Rspamd internals:

```lua
-- /etc/rspamd/plugins.d/my_custom_check.lua
local rspamd_logger = require "rspamd_logger"

local function check_sender_reputation(task)
  local from = task:get_from('smtp')
  if not from or not from[1] then
    return false
  end

  local sender = from[1].addr:lower()

  -- Check Redis for sender reputation
  local function redis_cb(err, data)
    if err or not data then
      return
    end

    local score = tonumber(data)
    if score and score > 10 then
      task:insert_result('SENDER_BAD_REPUTATION', 1.0, tostring(score))
    end
  end

  local redis_params = rspamd_parse_redis_server('my_redis_db')
  rspamd_redis.make_request(task, redis_params, sender,
    'GET', {'sender_rep:' .. sender}, redis_cb)

  return true  -- Indicate async operation
end

rspamd_config:register_symbol({
  name = 'SENDER_BAD_REPUTATION',
  type = 'normal',
  callback = check_sender_reputation,
  score = 5.0,
  group = 'custom',
  description = 'Sender has bad reputation in our database'
})
```
