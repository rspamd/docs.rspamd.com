# Rspamd selectors settings

Rspamd selectors is a Lua framework that allows functional extraction and processing of data from messages.



## Introduction

<center><img class="img-fluid" src="/img/selectors.png" width="50%"></center>

Starting from version 1.8, Rspamd introduces a framework designed for data extraction from messages and its subsequent utilization in plugins via transform functions. This functionality allows for a variety of operations. For instance, you can retrieve the SMTP from address and convert it to lowercase using the following selector:

```
smtp_from.lower
```

Similarly, you can obtain a lowercased digest of the subject and then truncate it to 16 hexadecimal characters:

```
header('Subject').lower.digest('hex').substring(1, 16)
```

Additionally, you have the capability to work with lists, such as lists of URLs:

```
urls:get_tld
```

Afterwards, these values can be used in various plugins:

* [`multimap`](../modules/multimap.html) - map type equal to `selector`
* [`ratelimit`](../modules/ratelimit.html) - rate bucket description with `selector` field
* [`reputation`](../modules/reputation.html) - generic selector rules
* [`regexp`](../modules/regexp.html) - regular expressions based on selector's data
* [`rbl`](../modules/rbl.html) - allows selectors in data queries
* [`clustering`] - TBD

Here is an example of Rspamd multimap rule that uses selectors to block bad Sendgrid senders using [Invaluement SPBL](https://www.invaluement.com/serviceproviderdnsbl/):

~~~hcl
# local.d/multimap.conf
INVALUEMENT_SENDGRID_ID {
  type = "selector";
  selector = 'header("X-SG-EID").id;from("smtp","orig").regexp("/^<?bounces\+(\d+)\-[^@]+@/i").last';
  map = "https://www.invaluement.com/spdata/sendgrid-id-dnsbl.txt";
  score = 6.0;
}

INVALUEMENT_SENDGRID_DOMAIN {
  type = "selector";
  map = "https://www.invaluement.com/spdata/sendgrid-envelopefromdomain-dnsbl.txt";
  selector = 'header("X-SG-EID").id;from("smtp","orig"):domain.get_tld';
  score = 6.0;
}
~~~

As evident from this rule, it skillfully employs a combination of map expressions and selectors to retrieve and modify data for queries within maps.

## Selectors syntax

A selector typically consists of two key components:

1. Data identification (such as `header` or `urls`)
2. An optional data transformation method, separated by a colon (`:`)
3. A transformation pipeline, where multiple functions are linked with dot operators (`.`)

Additionally, you can merge several selectors by using a semicolon (`;`) as a delimiter:

```
smtp_from.addr.lower;ip.addr
```

Both the data identification and transformation functions allow the use of arguments separated by commas. To simplify escaping, single and double quotation marks are supported:

```
header('Subject').regexp("^A-Z{10,}.*")
header('Subject').regexp("^A-Z{10,}\"'.*")
header('Subject').regexp('^A-Z{10,}"\'.*')
```

### Data transformation method

Certain data extractors yield intricate objects or lists of such objects, including:

- table
- userdata (Lua object)

To convert these complex entities into simpler ones (strings or string lists), there are two approaches: implicit conversion and employing the method or table key extraction.

1. For objects, implicit conversion involves invoking the `tostring` function, while the method call is straightforward. The following are equivalent: `ip:to_string.lower` and `ip.lower`. Nevertheless, different methods of the objects can be called: `urls:get_tld` will return a list of strings containing all eSLD parts of URLs in the message. An exception to this rule (starting from 2.7) is `rspamd_text`, which can be traversed within the selector pipeline without any conversion. This exemption aims to retain large strings to prevent Lua string interning and excessive allocation.

2. For tables, explicit conversion simply extracts the specified key, such as `from:addr` or `from('mime'):name`. Implicit conversion is slightly more intricate:

   - If the table contains a field named `value`, it is used for implicit conversion.
   - If not, and there is a field named `addr` in the table, it is used for implicit conversion.
   - If neither of the above conditions are met, `table.concat(t, ' ')` is used for implicit conversion.

### Null values

If a data transformation function or **any** transform function returns `nil`, the selector is entirely disregarded. This characteristic is employed in functions like `in` and `not_in`. An illustrative configuration for the `ratelimit` module that combines the `in` transformation with `id` to exclude the original string is as follows:

```lua
user_workdays = {
    selector = "user.lower;time('connect', '!%w').in(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).id('work')";
    bucket = "10 / 1m";
};
user_weekends = {
    selector = "user.lower;time('connect', '!%w').in(6, 7).id('weekends')";
    bucket = "1 / 1m";
};
```

In this example, during weekends, the `user_workdays` selector will be entirely disregarded, and conversely, during working days, the `user_weekends` selector will not be utilized.

## Selectors combinations

In the previous example, the selector comprised multiple components:

* `user.lower` - extracts the authenticated username and converts it to lowercase
* `time('connect', '!%w').in(6, 7).id('weekends')` - if the connection time falls within the specified range, it returns the string 'weekends'

These two elements are separated by the `;` symbol. Modules will utilize these elements as a concatenated string, for instance, `user@example.com:weekends` (the `:` symbol serves as a separator and is employed by the ratelimit module).

However, what if you want to achieve the same functionality for, let's say, recipients:

```lua
rcpt_weekends = {
    selector = "rcpts.take_n(5).lower;time('connect', '!%w').in(6, 7).id('weekends')";
    bucket = "1 / 1m";
};
```

In this instance, we're taking up to `5` recipients, extracting the address part, converting it to lowercase, and combining it with the string `weekends` if the condition is met. When a list of elements is concatenated with a string, this string is appended (or prepended) to each element of the list, resulting in the following:

```
rcpt1:weekends
rcpt2:weekends
rcpt3:weekends
```

It also works if you want to add a prefix and a suffix:

```lua
rcpt_weekends = {
    selector = "id('rcpt');rcpts:addr.take_n(5).lower;time('connect', '!%w').in(6, 7).id('weekends')";
    bucket = "1 / 1m";
};
```

This configuration will be transformed into:

```
rcpt:rcpt1:weekends
rcpt:rcpt2:weekends
rcpt:rcpt3:weekends
```

However, combining lists with different numbers of entries is not recommended â€“ in this case, the shortest of the lists will be used:

```lua
id('rcpt');rcpts.take_n(5).lower;urls.get_host.lower
```

This will result in a list that might have up to 5 elements and will be concatenated with the prefix:

```
rcpt:rcpt1:example.com
rcpt:rcpt2:example2.com
rcpt:rcpt3:example3.com
```

## Data definition functions

You can access the latest list of all selector functions and also test Rspamd selector pipelines through the integrated Web Interface. This provides you with a convenient way to explore and experiment with Rspamd's selector capabilities.

### Maps in transformations

Starting from version 2.0, Rspamd introduces support for using maps within selectors. This is achieved by incorporating maps into a designated `lua_selectors.maps` table. The table should consist of name-value pairs where the `name` represents the symbolic name of the map, which can be employed in extraction or transformation functions, and the `value` is the output of `lua_maps.map_add_from_ucl`. To illustrate this concept:


~~~lua
local lua_selectors = require "lua_selectors"
local lua_maps = require "lua_maps"

lua_selectors.maps.test_map = lua_maps.map_add_from_ucl({
    'key value',
    'key1 value1',
    'key3 value1',
  }, 'hash', 'test selectors maps')

local samples = {
    ["map filter"] = {
      selector = "id('key').filter_map(test_map)",
      expect = {'key'}
    },
    ["map apply"] = {
      selector = "id('key').apply_map(test_map)",
      expect = {'value'}
    },
    ["map filter list"] = {
      selector = "list('key', 'key1', 'key2').filter_map(test_map)",
      expect = 
    },
    ["map apply list"] = {
      selector = "list('key', 'key1', 'key2', 'key3').apply_map(test_map)",
      expect = 
    },
    ["map apply list uniq"] = {
      selector = "list('key', 'key1', 'key2', 'key3').apply_map(test_map).uniq",
      expect = 
    },
}
~~~


## Type safety

All selectors provide type safety controls. It means that Rspamd checks if types within pipeline match each other. For example, `rcpts` extractor returns a list of addresses, and `from` returns a single address. If you need to lowercase this address you need to convert it to a string as the first step. This could be done by getting a specific element of this address, e.g. `from.addr` -> this returns a `string` (you could also get `from.name` to get a displayed name, for example). Each processor has its own list of the accepted types.

However, even when dealing with recipients, where `rcpt` generates a list of addresses, you can still employ the same pipeline, such as `rcpts.addr.lower`. This versatility is possible because many processors can be functionally applied like a map:

```
elt1 -> f(elt1) -> elt1'
elt2 -> f(elt2) -> elt2'
elt3 -> f(elt3) -> elt3'
```

Hence, a list of elements of type `t` undergoes an element-wise transformation using processor `f`, creating a new list of type `t1` (which can be the same as `t`). The length of the resulting list remains unchanged.

To enhance convenience, the ultimate values can be implicitly converted to their string representation. This is particularly applicable to URLs, email addresses, and IP addresses, all of which can be seamlessly converted to strings.

In general, you need not be overly concerned about type safety unless you encounter actual type errors. This mechanism serves to safeguard the selectors framework from inadvertent user errors.

## Own selectors

You have the option to incorporate your custom extractors and processing functions. However, it's crucial to implement this setup before utilizing these selectors in any other context. For instance, the execution of `rspamd.local.lua` precedes the initialization of plugins, making it a secure location to register your functions. Here is a small example about how to register your own extractors and processors.

~~~lua
local lua_selectors = require "lua_selectors" -- Import module

lua_selectors.register_extractor(rspamd_config, "get_something", {
  get_value = function(task, args) -- mandatory field
    return task:get_something(),'string' -- result + type
  end,
  description = 'Sample extractor' -- optional
})

lua_selectors.register_processor(rspamd_config, "append_string", {
  types = {['string'] = true}, -- accepted types
  process = function(input, type, args)
    return input .. table.concat(args or {}),'string' -- result + type
  end,
  map_type = 'string', -- can be used in map like invocation, always return 'string' type
  description = 'Adds all arguments to the input string'
})

-- List processor example
lua_selectors.register_transform(rspamd_config, "take_second", {
  types = {['list'] = true}, -- accepted types
  process = function(input, t)
    return input[2],t:match('^(.*)_list$') -- second element and list type
  end,
  desctiption = 'Returns the second element of the list'
})
~~~

You can use these functions in your selectors subsequently.

## Regular expressions selectors

You can also leverage selectors with Rspamd's [regexp module](../modules/regexp.html). This approach allows you to utilize the data extracted and processed by the selector framework to match it against various regular expressions.

To start, you'll need to register a selector in the regexp module. You can achieve this by adding the following code to your `rspamd.local.lua` file:

~~~lua
rspamd_config:register_re_selector('test', 'user.lower;header(Subject).lower', ' ')
~~~

The first argument denotes the symbolic name of the selector, which you will subsequently use to reference it in regular expression rules. The second argument entails the selector in the usual syntax. The last argument, which is optional, designates the character used to concatenate the different selector parts. In this manner, the selector generates a value by joining the authenticated user and the `Subject` header's value using a space character.

Following this, you can refer to this selector in your regular expression rules. The order in which you use the selector's name and its registration in the code doesn't impact its functionality.

~~~lua
config['regexp']['TEST_SELECTOR_RE'] = {
  re = 'test=/user some subject/$',
  score = 100500,
}
~~~

The syntax for regular expressions involving selectors bears some resemblance to header regular expressions. You begin by stating the selector's name, followed by `=` and the actual regular expression, concluded with `$` to signify the type. The omission of the `$` sign alerts Rspamd that you are specifying a header regular expression, rather than a selector-based one. It is essential to include this symbol to ensure clarity. Alternatively, you can utilize the extended syntax for the re type:

~~~lua
config['regexp']['TEST_SELECTOR_RE'] = {
  re = 'test=/user some subject/{selector}',
  score = 100500,
}
~~~

If a selector yields multiple values, such as recipients, the corresponding regular expression will be matched against all the elements within that list. Consequently, it becomes crucial to incorporate the `one_shot` option to prevent inadvertent insertion of multiple symbols:

~~~lua
rspamd_config:register_re_selector('test_rcpt', 'rcpts.addr.lower;header(Subject).lower', ' ')
config['regexp']['TEST_SELECTOR_RCPT'] = {
  re = 'test_rcpt=/user@example.com some subject/{selector}',
  score = 100500,
  one_shot = true,
}
~~~

It's noteworthy that data retrieved through selectors is internally cached, allowing you to safely reuse it across multiple regular expressions (in case of `Hyperscan` support multiple regular expressions will also be composed as usually).
