These hashes expire after a predetermined length of time, which can be set to a maximum of 24 hours by default. Additionally, the module creates hashes of the in-reply-to headers of all received messages and checks them for matches, i.e., messages that were sent in response to messages that our system initiated. After that it approves all recipients of the current sender and adds them to the local replies set of this sender (default maximum size is 20). local replies set is used to check approved recipients for current sender. This local replies set has the time to expire (default is 1 day) after which it is removed from the redis. After this all recipients are also added to the global replies set (default maximum size is 30). global replies set is used to determine whether the sender is approved.
